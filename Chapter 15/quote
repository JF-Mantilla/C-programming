    C   is quirky,  flawed,       and   and
enormous success.    Although accidents of history  
surely helped,    it   evidently satified  a need

    for a system implementation language efficient
    enough  ti displace      assembly language, 
       yet sufficiently abstract   and fluent  to describe
    algorithms and  interactions  in a  wide variety
    of environtments.   
                        --      Dennis M.   Ritchie
